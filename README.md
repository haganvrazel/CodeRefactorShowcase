# Project README

## Overview

This project consists of a set of functions for interacting with a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The goal is to manage user and payment data efficiently. The provided code includes functionalities for querying and processing user and payment information, as well as tests to ensure the correct behavior of these functionalities.

## Code Files

### `incorrect.js`

This file contains a number of functions that have been initially implemented but require fixing. The functions aim to:

- `pullFirstUser(userIds)`: Find the first user from a list of IDs.
- `pullPaymentsForUsers(users)`: Retrieve payments for a list of users.
- `convertToStr(num)`: Convert a number to a string.
- `getPaymentWithUser(paymentId)`: Retrieve a payment and its associated user.
- `getGroupedUserPmts(userIds)`: Group payments by user.

### `correct.js`

This file contains the corrected versions of the functions from `incorrect.js`. The updated implementations use modern JavaScript practices and include:

- Error handling
- Asynchronous operations with `async/await`
- Mongoose object ID validation
- Logging for better debugging

### `correct_tests.js`

This file contains tests for the functions defined in `correct.js`. It ensures that the functions perform as expected by:

- Validating the `pullFirstUser` function with different user IDs
- Checking the results of `pullPaymentsForUsers`
- Testing the `convertToStr` function for correct conversion of ObjectIds
- Verifying the behavior of `getPaymentWithUser`
- Confirming the output of `getGroupedUserPmts`

### `models.js`

This file defines the Mongoose schemas and models used in the project:

- **User Schema**: Defines fields for user data including `active`, `signup_date`, `created`, and `updated`.
- **Payment Schema**: Defines fields for payment data including `name`, `active`, `amount`, `date`, `user`, `created`, and `updated`.

### Notes
- The `correct.js` file is the corrected version of the `incorrect.js` file. It includes proper error handling, validation, and asynchronous code practices.
- Ensure MongoDB is properly configured and running before executing tets.
- The `model.js` file should be used for database connections and schema definitions.
